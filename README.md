# MongoDB-Technique-Demo
A demonstration of MongoDB proficiency using made-up data, showcasing various querying techniques, data manipulation, and database design concepts.

# Dataset
The data in Table 1 was provided by the class professor and do not represent any real world dataset.

# Methodology
This project showcases proficiency in NoSQL database design and querying using MongoDB, leveraging the same made-up dataset used for demonstrations. The methodology includes structuring data in a flexible, schema-less format using JSON-like documents, optimizing for scalability and performance. It explores key NoSQL concepts such as document embedding, referencing, and indexing for efficient queries. Various CRUD operations, aggregation pipelines, and complex queries are implemented to extract insights from the data. Additionally, best practices in data modeling, including denormalization and sharding considerations, are applied to demonstrate real-world use cases for NoSQL databases.
